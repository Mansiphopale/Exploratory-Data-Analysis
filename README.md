1. Understanding the Dataset
Identify the dataset structure: Check the number of rows, columns, and data types.
Read metadata: Understand what each column represents and the relationships between variables.
Check missing values: Identify if there are any missing or null values that need to be handled.
2. Univariate Analysis (Single Variable)
Numerical Features: Calculate summary statistics like mean, median, min, max, standard deviation, and percentiles.
Categorical Features: Count the occurrences of each category to understand distribution.
Visualizations: Use histograms, boxplots, and bar charts to explore individual column distributions.
3. Bivariate Analysis (Two Variables)
Numerical vs. Numerical: Use scatter plots and correlation matrices to identify relationships between numerical features.
Categorical vs. Numerical: Compare distributions of numerical values across categories using boxplots or violin plots.
Categorical vs. Categorical: Use bar charts or heatmaps to understand the frequency of category combinations.
4. Multivariate Analysis (Multiple Variables)
Pairwise Relationships: Use pair plots or heatmaps to detect trends and interactions between multiple features.
Dimensionality Reduction: Techniques like PCA (Principal Component Analysis) can help visualize high-dimensional data.
5. Handling Missing or Outlier Data
Missing Values:
Remove rows/columns with too many missing values.
Impute missing values using mean, median, or mode.
Outliers:
Detect outliers using boxplots or z-scores.
Decide whether to remove, transform, or cap extreme values.
6. Feature Engineering & Transformation
Scaling & Normalization: Standardize or normalize numerical features if required.
Encoding Categorical Variables: Convert categorical data into numerical format using one-hot encoding or label encoding.
Feature Selection: Identify the most important features that contribute to the analysis.
7. Insights & Summary
Summarize key observations from the data.
Identify patterns, trends, and potential challenges.
Decide on the next steps, such as model selection or further data cleaning.
